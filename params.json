It's intended as a base for plugins to various content management systems.\r\n\r\nWe are a group of three engineering students studying on Technical University of Gdansk's IT Faculty (http://eti.pg.gda.pl/)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease remember that:\r\n* We are not associated with PHP Security consortium in any way.\r\n* PHPSecLib available at phpseclib.com is not our project.\r\n\r\n#Index\r\n  - Current status\r\n  - What is available in this package\r\n  - Development roadmap\r\n  - Libraries used\r\n  - License\r\n  - Contact\r\n\r\n#Current status\r\n\r\nPHPSEC component is curently in beta stage. Therefore it's unfit for use in production environment.\r\n\r\n#What is available in this package\r\n\r\nIn this repo you will find sample web application using PHPSEC component as well as database dump to use along with it. Expect wordpress plugins in the next few days.\r\n\r\n#Development roadmap\r\n\r\nALPHA:\r\n\r\n  - sample web application using component\r\n  - database data+explanations how to use\r\n  - wordpress plugin using at least half the components functionality\r\n\r\nBETA:\r\n\r\n  - Wordpress plugin completion\r\n  - Additional user-friendly documentation\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION-FIT:\r\n\r\n  - When stable, tested and ready to deploy\r\n\r\n#Libraries used\r\n- [phpMailer] - [LGPL 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)\r\n- [GoogleAuthenticate] - Apache 2.0 License\r\n\r\n#License\r\nApache 2.0\r\n\r\n#Contact\r\nFeel free to contact us @ contact[at]phpsec.tk\r\nIf you have any questions feel free to visit our forum [phpsec.tk]\r\n\r\n[phpMailer]:https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer\r\n[GoogleAuthenticate]:https://github.com/ceeram/GoogleAuthenticate\r\n[phpsec.tk]:http://phpsec.tk\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-60249705-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
