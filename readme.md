# PHPSEC

The purpose of this project is to create a PHP component providing tools to easily implement multi-stage multi-method authentication. It's intended as a base for plugins to various content management systems.

We are a group of three engineering students studying on Technical University of Gdansk's IT Faculty (http://eti.pg.gda.pl/)
